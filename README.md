Pre-Match Tennis Prediction Model

My final project will be a prediction model for ATP tennis matches. Data will be sourced from the JeffSackman GitHub repository on tennis matches. The features I will be adding are explained below

1.	Ranking at time of match
a.	This will compare the ranking of both players before the match starts using historical ranking data
2.	Surface win %
a.	I will use historical data to create a running yearly win percentage on the different surfaces. Tennis is played on grass, hard, and clay throughout the year
3.	H2H
a.	This will comprise of two parts. The first part will be a running win loss tally which shows which player has the edge in previous meetings. Second, I will create a metric that factors in the number of games played along with the sets played in previous matches
4.	Confidence
a.	This will be a two-part metric which factors in the confidence each player is coming the match with. For example, the confidence would be high if the player had beat a higher ranked player before the match or if the player had won a tournament prior
5.	Year form
a.	A running percent win statistic for each player throughout the year. Previous studies have included a positive “penalty” term for better recent performance
